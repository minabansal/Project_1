* The kind of data you'd like to work with/field you're interested in (e.g., geodata, weather data, etc.)

 Book/bestseller data

* The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data

 q 1 - what age do authors tend to publish their bestselling books? (look within genre, decades, etc)
 
 q 2 - who are their influences? Is this different across different genres or age groups?
 
 q 3 - do certain countries produce more bestsellers than others?
 
 q 4 - is there a correlation between gender and genre?
 
 q 5 - are bestselling authors one-hit wonders or consistently produce bestselling books?
 
 q 6 - is there a trend of certain genres/topics being more prevent according to economy? (do we see more wartime book during war or escapism/fiction during economic downturn) - US data.gov or bs.gove for unemployment data and gdp data

* Possible source for such data

Goodreads - Author Data
NYT - bestseller lists
	
Proposal - Our project is to uncover patterns in author data and bestsellers using Goodreads for
author information and NYT for bestseller lists. We'll examine relationships between 
the age of the author when their book was published and genre; 
the most influential authors; 
whether certain countries produce more bestselling authors compared to others; 
whether there is a correlation between gender and genre; 
and the author ratings (does the goodreads author rating correspond to the number of NYT bestsellers?)

Steps:
1) Set up API for NYT 
2) Clean up Data - (how?)
3) 

Q1 - what age do authors tend to publish their bestselling books? (look within genre, decades, etc)

* create a new column for age when published
* scatterplot?
	
Q2 - who are their influences? Is this different across different genres or age groups?

* how many unique author influences?

Q3 - do certain countries produce more bestsellers than others?

* bar plot of countries and count of bestselling titles?

Q4 - is there a correlation between gender and genre?

* double bar plot of gender and genre?

Q5 - are bestselling authors one-hit wonders or consistently produce bestselling books?

* scatterplot of genre and count of bestselling authors?
	
q 6 - is there a trend of certain genres/topics being more prevent according to economy? (do we see more wartime book during war or escapism/fiction during economic downturn) - US data.gov or bs.gove for unemployment data and gdp data
